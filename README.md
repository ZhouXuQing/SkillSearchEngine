Creator: Steven Williams

* 'PostgreSQL 11'
* 'macOS'
* 'Simple (text only) .pdf file' 

## Setup

This project can be imported using Eclipse. File -> Import -> Git -> Clone URI.
Apache PDFBox 2.0.14 is used and the dependencies can be found here: https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi. 
Include them in your classpath by right-clicking on the project name (package explorer) -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Add External JARs. 

Once you have the project imported the project, Postgres.app is the easiest way to get going for the SQL server: https://postgresapp.com. Please note that this is specifically for macOS. Other OS versions can be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/. You will also need the PostgreSQL driver, navigate to the middle of the page or just click here: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html. At the time of writing this, I am using the 'current version' of 42.2.5. Make sure you add this .jar to your classpath as outlined above. You should be all set! Once you compile and run, you can follow the tutorial below.
